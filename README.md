# Research-Statistical-Thermodynamics
Molecular Dynamic Simulation using non-uniform time-steps which are determined based on the next nearest collision, either between molecules or between a molecules and one of the (left, right, bottom, top) walls; the positions and velocities of all molecules involved in the current collision are then updated to produce the current scene/frame.
